Git (/ɡɪt/)[8] is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).[9][10][11]

Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[12] Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[13] Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license. 




The question is not how strong a password looks like but how strong it actually is. SHA-256 does not add any entropy at all, so it all depends on what the input to SHA-256 was. And the entropy of the chosen input is pretty low: Assuming that the attacker knows how the password was created, they can test all possible inputs around the time the password might have been created.

A much stronger input would be to use real random data as input:

dd if=/dev/random bs=1 count=32 | sha256sum

While the output might look similar strong, it is practically impossible to predict the input by the attacker.
